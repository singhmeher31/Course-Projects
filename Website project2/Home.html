    <p> There are very few Indian players who can claim to rival Sachin Tendulkar’s popularity. MS Dhoni is certainly one of them. The wicketkeeper-batsman took India’s domestic cricket by storm using brute force. His ability to consistently hit the ball out of stadiums held the domestic circuit in thrall.

Dhoni lived up to his billing and didn’t take long to seal a place across all formats after making his ODI debut in 2004. For years, India craved for a wicket-keeper batsman who could beat the daylights out of opposition bowlers lower down the order, and Dhoni turned out to be that.

His legend grew to another level after he captained India to the trophy in the inaugural World T20 in 2007. In 2011, he led the team to another World Cup win, this time in the 50-overs format besides winning the Champions Trophy in 2013. He also captained the Test team to No.1 in the ICC rankings, a first for the Indian cricket team.

Dhoni retired from Tests in December 2014 and gave up captaincy of limited-overs teams in early 2017. In the twilight of his career, he still retains his power hitting and ability to finish off matches with composure of the highest order. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MS_Dhoni" target="_blank">Click for more ... </a>
