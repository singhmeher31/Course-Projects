    In the course duration of web designing and internet, I have created few projects which represents my development skills. 
    The projects that I have created are available at: <a href="https://github.com/singhmeher31/Course-Projects">Github link</a>

            During the course of Mark up languages, I have created two websites where I have used various technical languages such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, Bootstrap.
             The editor used for coding is visual studio. JQuery is used for having a slideToggle which is used for hiding and displaying the content. 
            Bootstrap is used for having a carousel to slideshow the images.
            </p>
   
        <div class="project">
       <pre> <a href="https://github.com/singhmeher31/Course-Projects/tree/master/Website%20Project"><img src="Images/Project1.jpg" alt="project1" width="400" > </a>   <a href="https://github.com/singhmeher31/Course-Projects/tree/master/Website%20project2"><img src="Images/Project2.jpg" alt="project2" width="400"> </a> </pre>

        </li>

        <p>During the course of Animation, I have created a pilot bird game where I have used action scripting. 
        I have created the bird, background, blocks and then animated the scenes accordingly. 
        After this I have coded it in such a way so that the player has to keep flying the bird using the keyboard keys and if it hit the blocks, 
        the game will be over otherwise after crossing every block the score will keep getting increased and displayed on the screen.
        As the game progresses, the difficulty level rises.
        </p>

        In the MySQl database, the tables are created according to the data available in the html webpage which stores the data every time a new user provides there information.
